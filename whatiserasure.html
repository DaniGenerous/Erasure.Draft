In 1876, the Battle of the Little Bighorn occured near the Little Bighorn River in Montana Territory. The conflict involved federal troops commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer and a coalition of Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne warriors. Tensions had been high since the discovery of gold on Native American lands, so when several tribes failed to meet a federal relocation deadline, the U.S. Army--including Custer and the 7th Cavalry--were sent to confront them. Unaware of the substantial number of Indian warriors under Sitting Bull's command, Custer's forces were outnumbered and swiftly overwhelmed, resulting in the historic event known as Custer's Last Stand.<a href="https://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/battle-of-the-little-bighorn" class="read-more-link">Read more.</a>

                   In an attempt to assimilate Native Americans, President Grover Cleveland signs the Dawes Severalty Act, ending tribal control of reservations and dividing their land into individual holdings. The act allowed the president to divide reservations into privately owned plots, with men receiving 160 acres, single adult men getting 80 acres, and boys receiving 40 acres; women receiving no land. Motivated by a desire for native territory, the act resulted in the loss of 86 million acres, or 62 percent of pre-1887 Indian holdings. The promised benefits for Native Americans do not materialize. Despite flaws and resistance from tribes, the Dawes Act remains in force for over four decades until the Wheeler-Howard Act of 1934 seeks to restore tribal control and cultural autonomy.<a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/cleveland-signs-the-dawes-severalty-act" class="read-more-link">Read more.</a>

                    In 1971, a collective of Native Americans from the San Francisco Bay area, identifying as the "Indians of All Tribes," set forth to Alcatraz Island with the aspiration of establishing an Indian school, cultural center, and museum. Asserting their right to the island based on the concept of "discovery," drawing a parallel to the European colonization of North America, they declared Alcatraz as rightfully theirs. However, on June 11, 1971, armed federal marshals intervened, leading to the removal of the last remaining Indian occupants from the island.

                   With merely 2,000 Cherokees voluntarily relocating from their lands in Georgia to cross the Mississippi River, President Martin Van Buren employs General Winfield Scott and 7,000 troops to expedite the process. This is achieved through coercion, as the Cherokees are held at gunpoint and forced to march 1,200 miles. The harrowing journey results in the deaths of over 5,000 Cherokee individuals. This tragic episode, marked by the forced relocations of Native American tribes and the immense suffering and loss of life during the journey, becomes historically recognized as the Trail of Tears. <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/trail-of-tears" class="read-more-link">Read more.</a>

                    In 1864, Colonel John Chivington and his Colorado volunteers massacred Southern Cheyenne and Arapahoe Native Americans at Sand Creek, Colorado. The conflict arose from tensions over control of the Great Plains, exacerbated by the Treaty of Fort Wise's failure to sustain tribes. Chivington's troops attacked Chief Black Kettle's band on November 29, 1864, resulting in the deaths of 148 Native Americans--predominantly women and children. Although initially praised, the massacre later faced condemnation as the truth emerged. Chivington resigned, and Black Kettle continued peace efforts, leading his followers to a new reservation in Indian Territory in 1865.

                    In the late 19th century, the U.S. government forcibly sent Native American children to "assimilation" boarding schools with the goal of eradicating their cultural identity. This harsh approach aimed to "kill the Indian in him, and save the man," as expressed by U.S. cavalry captain Richard Henry Pratt, the founder of Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania. Students faced deadly infections, and nearly 200 children were buried at Carlisle between 1879 and 1918. Boarding schools, part of broader assimilation attempts, forbade Native languages and practices, giving children new names and identities.

Nearly half of the casualties were women and children, conversely, 25 U.S. cavalrymen died that day. Originally termed a "battle," in reality it was a massacre that marked one of the final tragic episodes in the Indian Wars.  <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/wounded-knee" class="read-more-link">Read more.</a>

In 1973, American Indian Movement members occupied Wounded Knee to protest historical injustices and poor living conditions on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Lasting 71 days, the standoff resulted in two deaths. AIM leaders surrendered after securing promises of investigations. Post-occupation, violence persisted, leading to more confrontations. In a 1975 shoot-out, two FBI agents and a Native man died.
