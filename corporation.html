              “What really has been driving me through this project (is) for there to be other Natives in the airport. They'll be like, 'Oh, that's beadwork,’ and really resonate with that and feel a sense of, like, place,” Cliff says with a gentle laugh. “While these are our homelands, I feel like we don't have a sense of place a lot of times.”

        <h2>Mona Cliff & the MCI Airport</h2>
    
        <div class="description">
<p>
          MCI, the Kansas City Airport, was completely renovated as of 2023. While in the process of doing so, MCI recruited 19 local artists to create work for the newly designed airport. Indigenous artist Mona Cliff being one of the nineteen. To the left is her beadwork piece inspired by the Kansas prairie. Having learned the art of beadworking from her grandmother, Cliff notes that "generational knowledge is at the forefront of [her] art practice." Cliff describes her art as focusing on how "traditional arts are passed down between generations of women." This elaborate piece, made on panels of cherry wood, comprised of thousands of beads held together by beeswax, copal resin and pine rosin, is over 17 feet long. The piece can be viewed near Gate B51.

            <div class="description">
            <p>In 2020, Wells Fargo launched a campaign entitled, "Working for Generations" where they commissioned five different native American artists to design credit/debit cards as a means of celebrating Native American culture across the country. Additionally, Wells Fargo began a "Invest Native" initiative--this campaign follows Wells Fargo completion of their 2017-2022 "$50 million commitment to address American Indian and Alaska Native communities’ unique economic, social and environmental needs." The President of Wells Fargo Foundation, Otis Rolley, noted that the Invest Native initiative aims to "address housing, small business, financial health, and sustainability among Native American communities in Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming."</p>

    <p>After 87 years, the "Washington Redskins," name was officially retired in 2022. Suzan Harjo, an advocate for the name change, said in an interview with NPR that the "r-word" equated to "emotional and physical violence" against Native Americans. She deemed the name change a "a huge step forward." </p>

    <p>Previously known as the Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows, Palisades Tahoe changed their name in light of discovering that the word "squaw" is considered to be "offensive, derogatory, racist, and misogynistic." The Washoe Tribe, whose ancestral land lies on the resort, praised the decision as the original title was a "constant reminder of the unjust treatment of the Native people, of the Washoe people," said Darrel Cruz of the Washoe Tribe Historic Preservation Office in an interview with NPR.</p>

    <p>Mutual of Omaha, an insurance company in Nebraska, had a logo depicting a Native American since the 1950s. In 2021 the company decided to change their logo, noting that they desired to be "part of the change." In addition to the changed look, company officials expressed their plans to require more training on diversity and inclusion.</p>

    <p>After almost 100 years of the indigenous woman named "Mia" being placed on the logo of the Land O'Lakes butter tub, in 2020 the company opted for a re-design. After the change, Minnesota Lt. Governor and White Earth Band of Ojibwe member Peggy Flanagan wrote a thank you to the company for the change, writing in a tweet, “Native people are not mascots or logos. We are very much still here.”</p>
