        <p>The casting of white actors to portray Native American characters in films has had a detrimental impact on authentic representation and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. The ever so popular genre of <span class="italic-text">Cowboys vs. Indians</span> enforced damaging tropes that reinforces the mischaracterization and exoticization of Native cultures. To this day, many Americans' only knowledge of Indigenous culture comes from these movies. Not to mention that these roles are often not even played by Indigenous actors, but rather, white men in face paint. Below are some notorious examples of white actors playing Native American characters in Hollywood blockbusters.</p>

                  <p>
                    Upon Marlon Brando being awarded "Best Supporting Actor" at the 1973 Oscars for his role as Don Corleone in <span class="italic-text">The Godfather</span>, Brando sent up Sacheen Littlefeather to decline the award on his behalf. Sacheen Littlefeather, an Apache activist, aspiring actress, and then president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee, also attended the Alcatraz occupation alongside John Trudell. She noted in her speech that Brando's reason for doing so was a result of the “treatment of the Native Americans by the film industry... and on television in movie reruns," as well as to bring attention to the Wounded Knee occupation in South Dakota. Littlefeather was met with boos and mockery from the audience and dealt with harassment for years following this event, as well as becoming blacklisted from the entertainment industry. It was not until a week prior to her death, nearly 50 years after her appearance at the Academy Awards, that the Academy apologized to Littlefeather.
